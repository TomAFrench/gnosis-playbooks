# Gnosis Playbooks

This package allows defining templates of sets of actions in a YAML file known as a playbook. Each action defined in the playbook lists the arguments required to execute it in such a way that a form can be automatically. This allows us to build "one layer up" from the Gnosis [Transaction Builder](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4680071-transaction-builder) by being able to quickly define relatively complex transaction batches without having to write a custom Gnosis Safe App.
